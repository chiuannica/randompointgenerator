A basketball game simulator. Pretty silly. I am a Steph Curry fan. Just tryna learn JS.

Hello. This is a basketball simulator that has two players. Each player has different stats, percentages for three pointers,
two pointers, and three pointers.

You can change the stats and regenerate the table.

In basketball, if you miss your shot, the other team gets a chance to score, and it continues. 

Did you know that even Steph Curry, one of the splash brothers and amazing Warriors player, only makes ~45 out of every 100 3-point shot?
That's many times more than I could, but this man is a professional! Nothing but respect to Mr. Curry.

This is nothing to be taken seriously. Trying to get the hang of JavaScript and git commands. :)
